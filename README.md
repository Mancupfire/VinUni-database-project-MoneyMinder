# Database Management

# 📌 MoneyMinder: Personal Finance Management System

## 📄 Brief Description
**MoneyMinder** is a comprehensive database-driven application designed to help individuals track their income, expenses, and savings goals. 

**The Problem:** Many individuals struggle to maintain financial health due to scattered data across various bank accounts and cash transactions, leading to a lack of visibility into spending habits and difficulty in adhering to budgets.

**The Solution:** This system solves this problem by providing a centralized platform to record financial transactions, categorize spending, and visualize financial health through generated reports. It leverages a relational database to ensure data integrity and allow for complex querying of financial history.

## 🎯 Functional & Non-functional Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1.  **User Management:** Users can register, login, and manage their profiles securely.
2.  **Transaction Management:** Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) income and expense records.
3.  **Categorization:** Transactions must be linked to specific categories (e.g., Groceries, Rent, Salary).
4.  **Budgeting:** Users can set monthly budget limits for specific categories and receive alerts when nearing limits.
5.  **Reporting:** The system generates monthly financial summaries and visualizes spending distribution.

### Non-functional Requirements
1.  **Data Integrity:** The database must strictly enforce referential integrity (foreign keys) and ACID properties for all transactions.
2.  **Security:** User passwords must be hashed; SQL injection prevention measures must be implemented.
3.  **Performance:** Queries for transaction history should execute in under 2 seconds for datasets up to 10,000 records.
4.  **Scalability:** The database schema should support the future addition of features like "Recurring Transactions" without major restructuring.

## 🧱 Planned Core Entities
*Brief outline of the database schema:*

1.  **Users:** Stores user credentials and profile information.
2.  **Accounts:** Represents different fund sources (e.g., Cash, Bank Account, Credit Card).
3.  **Categories:** Defines types of spending/income (e.g., Food, Utilities, Salary) to allow for grouping in reports.
4.  **Transactions:** The central fact table recording the amount, date, description, type (income/expense), and links to User, Account, and Category.
5.  **Budgets:** Stores the spending limits set by a user for a specific category within a specific time frame.
